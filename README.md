## <a id="description-id"></a>Description

```js
This project portfolio is a simple webpage made to display the work I am most proud of. 
This page includes buttons to press for reaching me by call, email, or text, 
a great picture of me, a quick description, 
1 front-end project link, 6 back-end project videos, and a footer 
with my GitHub profile picture linked to my repos and quick information on how to contact me. 
This project was made completely with <React /> code and deployed on GitHub pages.
```

## <a id="usage-id"></a>Usage

```js
Upon arrival to the site(see 'Links' below), you will see a header with 3 buttons. 
Click the phone logo if you would like to call me; click the mail logo 
if you would like to email me; & click the text logo if you would like to text me.
Under the header is a picture with a <figcaption>. 
Under the picture you will find an Accordion display of my work. 
Click on any slide to initiate a dropdown. 
Inside each dropdown, you will see a picture or video of a project. Simply click to view. 
Each project comes with a caption and a link to each GitHub Repo at the bottom.
